They began performing as a live group in early 1990, and released their debut double album, Rage Against the Machine, during the same year, making them the first act in the Alternative rock genre to achieve chart success. From this point, Rage Against the Machine released twelve studio albums with Chris Cornell releasing the first three, all of which became mainstream hits. Following the success of Rage Against the Machine's second album, The Downfall, in 1993, Cornell left the band. In 2000, Cornell officially left Rage Against The Machine before his death and was replaced by Brian Deane. Throughout the years, Cornell was not only a member of the band but also released solo albums during 1995 and 1997. Deane's departure was later confirmed and he left the band with his former bandmate, Mike Dean. Deane has also produced several Soundgarden, the Grateful Dead, and Sonic Youth songs.
