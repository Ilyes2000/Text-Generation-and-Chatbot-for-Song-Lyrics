I am yours too!\"  \r\nWell I said, \"I'll come back again, you'll come back too!\"  \r\nWell I said, I'll come back again, you'll come back too!  \r\nBut it broke my heart to hear the bells, bells in the rain  \r\nOh to hear the bells cry, \"There's something wrong with me\"  \r\nAnd her eyes filled with joy",

However, this has been fuelled by a variety of factors, including technological trends and the influence of foreign composers.\n\nDreams of literary revival are a common phenomenon among intellectuals. In his 1993 book, Nostalgia in Britain, Alan H. Gormley argues that the genre is not a \u201ctemporary form of nostalgia but a deeply rooted feature of British society.\u201d\n\nAs an example of this long-held concept of nostalgia, the late Peter de Beuvel, one of England\u2019s foremost writers, expressed his personal view on the subject in 1995. He noted that \u201cin Britain today, we are not nostalgically thinking about the past, but about present problems.\u201d Gormley notes, however, that the sense of nostalgia has a similar \u201ctimeless quality\u201d that can be traced back to the ancient Romans. He also states a similarity with the French sentiment: \u201cFrance has been, indeed, a pioneer in the kind of literature (such as it is) that has been thought and declared",
