In retrospect, the band's name seems almost fitting: the rugged, unblinking eyes of the bandmates seem to speak to an inner landscape that's dark and turbulent.\n\nThe album that really made me realize this is \"Fade In\" 1992, a self-titled effort that captures a raw, haunting, and ultimately poignant mood. The album was a bit of a departure from \"Lonely Widow,\" but \"Fade In\" showed the band at a level of maturity they'd never been before. The lyrics seemed slightly more introspective, but the music was far more mature.\n\nIt's been a while since I heard this album. The band's sound seemed less abrasive than much of the punk scene back then. The songwriting sounded more sophisticated. As an artist and a listener, you can't help but feel they've matured, perhaps more so than during \"Lonely Widow.\" But that's probably just the band revealing that this stuff feels comfortable after living it for so long.\n\nIt's also possible that the songs on the album have grown less desperate.
