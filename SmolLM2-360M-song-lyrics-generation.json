One day he played \"Crystal\" by David Bowie and I had my first introduction to heavy metal music. That was it, so it wasn't really a trend for me at all.

Once I got older, I actually got into a band. My band name was \"The New Wizards\" and that band was formed in the early 70's in Manchester, when it was a hardcore punk band.
