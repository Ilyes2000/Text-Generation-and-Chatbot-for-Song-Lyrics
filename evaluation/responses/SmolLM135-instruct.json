His father was the drummer of the American rock band Godiva, who had played the first guitar with Bowie in 1972. Bowie would later record a series of music videos. His mother had been a painter, and this gave his face an almost sculptural look. As his father began to play his guitar, the way he moved threw a lot of red and black-eyed peas into the air. His father became so involved in the art world, he never did it by his own will. Bowie developed an association with a sculptor. They both grew up in the same place, in Portland, Oregon, where the community of Portland was home to art galleries. They also grew up on the beaches of the Bay of Fundy on Long Island. The first musical event was a party last February in the Bayou City Hall, which in 1974 became the epicenter for Bowie's first bands. The music was about to become rock and roll. In May 1975, Bowie moved to Portland, where he was joined temporarily by his wife, Jill (Pete Hamill).
